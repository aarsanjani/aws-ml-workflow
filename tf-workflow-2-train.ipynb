Selecting the right hyperparameter values to train your model can be difficult, and typically is very time consuming if done manually. The right combination of hyperparameters is dependent on your data and algorithm; some algorithms have many different hyperparameters that can be tweaked; some are very sensitive to the hyperparameter values selected; and most have a non-linear relationship between model fit and hyperparameter values.
