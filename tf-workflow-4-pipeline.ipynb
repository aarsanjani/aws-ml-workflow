    "In the previous notesbooks, we prototyped various steps of a TensorFlow project within the notebook itself.  Notebooks are great for prototyping, but generally are  not used in production-ready machine learning pipelines.  For example, a simple pipeline in SageMaker includes the following steps:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Training the model.\n",
    "2. Creating a SageMaker Model object that wraps the model artifact for serving.\n",
    "3. Creating a SageMaker Endpoint Configuration specifying how the model should be served (e.g. hardware type and amount).\n",
    "4. Deploying the trained model to the configured SageMaker Endpoint.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The AWS Step Functions Data Science SDK automates the process of creating and running these kinds of workflows using AWS Step Functions and SageMaker.  It does this by allowing you to create workflows using short, simple Python scripts that define workflow steps and chain them together.  Under the hood, all the workflow steps are coordinated by AWS Step Functions without any need for you to manage the underlying infrastructure.  \n",
